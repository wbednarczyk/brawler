# Data Model

This document maps the UX and contracts to the first local SQLite data model. It is not a final migration file, but it should be concrete enough to guide the first schema implementation.

Use [Project Brief](project-brief.md) for the full documentation map. Related references: [Contracts](contracts.md), [Architecture](architecture.md), and [UI Information Architecture](ui-information-architecture.md).

## Model Principles

- SQLite is the local source of truth in v1.
- IDs are stable application IDs, not user-visible labels.
- Tickers are user-facing, but `qualified_ticker` is the uniqueness boundary.
- Fetched content and notes must preserve origin links.
- Transcript source output is immutable in v1.
- Settings are local and must not require cloud identity.
- Secrets live in the OS keychain, not in SQLite.
- YAML config is import/export/bootstrap, not runtime truth.
- Schema changes must be migration-managed from the first implementation milestone.

## Core Entities

### Companies

Supports Companies screen, company workspace, feed matching, notebooks, and transcript ownership.

Fields:

- `id`
- `exchange`
- `ticker`
- `qualified_ticker`
- `display_name`
- `isin`
- `cik`
- `lei`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Rules:

- `qualified_ticker` is unique.
- `ticker` alone is not unique.
- `isin`, `cik`, and `lei` are optional.

Related tables:

- `company_aliases`
- `company_source_ids`
- `company_registry_entries`

`company_source_ids` stores source-specific identifiers that cannot be derived reliably from the local ticker. For example, Bankier per-company komunikaty uses Bankier instrument slugs and tag IDs because short GPW tickers such as `CDR` may canonicalize to Bankier slugs such as `CDPROJEKT`.

### Watchlists

Supports the sidebar, Inbox filters, and first-run setup.

Fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `description`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Join table:

- `watchlist_companies`

Rules:

- A company can belong to multiple watchlists.
- Watchlists are user-maintained local data.

### Source Adapters

Supports Sources screen and ingestion jobs.

Fields:

- `id`
- `display_name`
- `source_type`
- `fetch_mode`
- `enabled`
- `default_poll_interval_seconds`
- `last_attempt_at` via `source_adapter_state`
- `last_success_at`
- `last_error_at`
- `last_error`
- `last_items_fetched` via `source_adapter_state`
- `last_items_created` via `source_adapter_state`
- `last_items_matched` via `source_adapter_state`
- `last_items_unmatched` via `source_adapter_state`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Related tables:

- `source_adapter_markets`
- `source_adapter_state`

Rules:

- Adapter IDs should be stable, for example `gpw-espi-ebi`.
- Source-specific cursors or checkpoints live in adapter state.

### Company Registry Entries

Supports company lookup, autocomplete, and ticker-first feed matching.

Fields:

- `id`
- `exchange`
- `ticker`
- `qualified_ticker`
- `display_name`
- `isin`
- `source_adapter_id`
- `source_url`
- `fetched_at`
- `active`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Rules:

- `exchange + ticker` is the uniqueness boundary.
- Registry records are cached source data, not user-owned company records.
- User-created companies are stored in `companies` and must not be overwritten silently by registry refresh.
- Feed matching should resolve source identifiers to ticker through this cache before using ISIN fallback.
- Slow refresh cadence is expected, initially daily or weekly.

### Feed Items

Supports Inbox, company Feed tab, source attribution, notes from feed, and AI analysis.

Fields:

- `id`
- `type`
- `source_adapter_id`
- `source_name`
- `source_url`
- `title`
- `summary`
- `body_text`
- `language`
- `published_at`
- `fetched_at`
- `display_company`
- `dedupe_key`
- `duplicate_signature`
- `read`
- `saved`
- `attribution`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Join table:

- `feed_item_companies`
- `feed_item_attachments`

Rules:

- `dedupe_key` should be unique per source adapter.
- `duplicate_signature` is nullable and may be used for cross-source article/media dedupe when two source adapters publish the same company-related item under different URLs or source-specific IDs.
- `fetched_at` is required.
- `published_at` may be null only when the source does not provide it.
- `display_company` is a UI read-model helper for early feed rows and unmatched/source-derived ticker labels. Canonical company relationships still live in `feed_item_companies`.
- Read and saved state are stored in SQLite and must survive app restart.
- Attachments are stored as ordered source links with `label` and `url`, scoped to a feed item.
- Retention policy must be designed before broad ingestion. Feed item storage should support cleanup without deleting saved items, items linked to notes, items with AI analysis, or items otherwise explicitly preserved by the user.

### Notebook Entries

Supports company notebooks, cross-company Notebooks screen, claims follow-up, and notes from feed/transcripts.

Fields:

- `id`
- `company_id`
- `title`
- `body`
- `body_format`
- `kind`
- `claim_status`
- `event_date`
- `follow_up_after`
- `follow_up_date`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Related tables:

- `notebook_entry_tags`
- `notebook_entry_origins`

Rules:

- `body_format` is `markdown` in v1.
- Notes belong to exactly one company.
- Claim notes may use both `follow_up_after` and `follow_up_date`.
- Origin links are required for notes created from feed items, AI outputs, or transcript segments.

### Company Events

Supports the Events screen, upcoming-company-event review, historical context, and future source-derived calendar ingestion.

Fields:

- `id`
- `company_id`
- `event_type`
- `title`
- `event_date`
- `event_time`
- `status`
- `source_type`
- `source_adapter_id`
- `source_event_key`
- `source_url`
- `attribution`
- `fetched_at`
- `manual`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Rules:

- Events belong to exactly one canonical company.
- `event_date` is required and stored as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `event_time` is optional and stored as local source-provided text until a source-specific time zone policy is required.
- Manual events use `source_type = manual` and `manual = 1`.
- Sourced events must preserve source URL, attribution, fetched timestamp, and source event key when available.
- `(source_adapter_id, source_event_key)` deduplicates sourced events when both values are present.
- `gpw-market-events-rss` is a source-backed event adapter and matches only tracked companies by exact ticker.
- `bankier-kalendarium-html` is the active broader public calendar adapter and matches only tracked companies by exact ticker.
- Bankier calendar source keys are based on ticker, event category, and event description so source-side date changes update the existing sourced event row.
- Source-keyed refresh updates sourced event rows when the accepted source changes the event.

### Transcript Jobs

Supports Transcripts screen and company Transcripts tab.

Fields:

- `id`
- `company_id`
- `provider_id`
- `source_type`
- `source_url`
- `source_label`
- `company_resolution_status`
- `recognized_company_candidates_json`
- `status`
- `error_code`
- `created_at`
- `started_at`
- `finished_at`
- `error`

Rules:

- Gemini is preferred only for YouTube transcription jobs.
- Source URL is required.
- The transcript workflow labels the source URL field as `URL`.
- `company_id` is nullable at job creation time.
- When a company/ticker is supplied before transcription, `company_id` is set and `company_resolution_status = provided`.
- When no company/ticker is supplied, the app may transcribe first, then attempt company recognition from transcript/provider output.
- If recognition fails, `company_resolution_status = needs_user_selection` and the UI must require company lookup/selection before transcript segments can become notebook notes.
- Allowed `company_resolution_status` values: `provided`, `recognized`, `unresolved`, `needs_user_selection`.
- Allowed `status` values: `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`.
- Allowed `error_code` values: `provider_not_configured`, `provider_limit`, `provider_unavailable`, `provider_error`, `network_error`, `invalid_source_url`, `parse_error`, `unknown`.
- `error` stores user-readable diagnostic text and must not store provider secrets.
- Jobs emit status changes to the UI.

### Transcript Segments

Supports transcript review and note creation from selected conference excerpts.

Fields:

- `id`
- `transcript_job_id`
- `company_id`
- `start_seconds`
- `end_seconds`
- `speaker`
- `text`
- `language`
- `created_at`

Rules:

- `company_id` is nullable until the parent transcript job is resolved to a company.
- Segment text is immutable source output in v1.
- Timestamps are optional because providers may return different precision.
- Notes created from transcript segments reference them through origin links.
- Transcript-derived notes are normal notebook entries; each selected segment creates a `transcript_segment` origin containing the segment ID, original video URL, and job/provider/timestamp context in the label.

### AI Analysis Results

Supports feed item summaries, significance labels, tags, and future provider-neutral analysis.

Fields:

- `id`
- `feed_item_id`
- `provider_id`
- `model`
- `prompt_version`
- `summary`
- `significance`
- `reasoning`
- `language`
- `created_at`

Related tables:

- `ai_analysis_jobs`
- `ai_analysis_tags`
- `ai_analysis_source_references`

Rules:

- General AI analysis is implemented later through a provider-neutral boundary. Gemini may be the first live provider, but stored analysis records must not assume Gemini is the only provider.
- M13 analysis runs through async job records with queued, running, succeeded, and failed states.
- Job records preserve prompt preset/custom-question context, provider ID, model, prompt version, error state, and timestamps.
- AI output must not contain buy/sell/hold recommendations.
- Source references are required.

### Jobs

Supports Sources screen, background ingestion, manual refresh, and transcript processing status.

Fields:

- `id`
- `type`
- `adapter_id`
- `transcript_job_id`
- `status`
- `started_at`
- `finished_at`
- `items_fetched`
- `items_created`
- `warnings_json`
- `error`

Rules:

- `adapter_id` is used for source polling jobs.
- `transcript_job_id` is used for transcript jobs when represented in the shared job list.
- Warnings can be JSON in v1 unless they need filtering.

### Settings

Supports theme selection, polling defaults, local privacy choices, and provider configuration.

Recommended storage:

- `settings` key/value table for simple local preferences
- optional structured JSON values for provider configuration

Initial keys:

- `theme`
- `accent_palette`
- `poll_interval_seconds`
- `youtube_transcription_provider`
- `youtube_transcription_model`
- `youtube_transcription_timeout_seconds`
- `general_analysis_provider`
- `ai_analysis_mode`
- `settings_import_export_format`
- `shortcut_bindings`

Rules:

- Default theme is `dark`.
- Default accent palette is `night-neon`.
- Default poll interval is `900`.
- Default YouTube transcription provider is `provider_gemini`.
- Default YouTube transcription model is `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- Default YouTube transcription timeout is `300` seconds.
- Default shortcut bindings are defined in code. `shortcut_bindings` stores only user overrides, disabled states, and resettable action-ID keyed changes as JSON.
- General AI provider remains unset until the AI analysis framework milestone configures one. The first live implementation may use Gemini, but provider storage must remain extensible.
- Default AI analysis mode is `source_grounded`.
- Runtime settings live in SQLite.
- YAML import/export excludes secrets and is contract-accepted but implementation-deferred until later export/import/backup work.
- Provider secrets are referenced indirectly and stored in the OS keychain.

## Origin Model

Notebook origin links should be flexible enough to connect notes to different source types.

Fields for `notebook_entry_origins`:

- `id`
- `notebook_entry_id`
- `source_type`
- `source_id`
- `source_url`
- `label`
- `created_at`

Allowed source types:

- `feed_item`
- `transcript_segment`
- `ai_analysis`
- `manual`
- `external_url`

Rules:

- Feed-created notes link to `feed_items`.
- Transcript-created notes link to selected `transcript_segments` and retain original YouTube URL through origin rows.
- Transcript-created notes require a resolved transcript job company before save.
- Manual notes may use a `manual` origin link or no external source.
- Normal note editing preserves existing origin links. Adding or detaching origins requires a future explicit source-link workflow.

## Company Event Model

Company events represent dated items for companies in watchlists. Upcoming events are the default product focus, but historical events are retained for context and comparison. They are not portfolio-position events and do not require holdings.

Fields for `company_events`:

- `id`
- `company_id`
- `event_type`
- `title`
- `event_date`
- `event_time`
- `status`
- `source_type`
- `source_adapter_id`
- `source_event_key`
- `source_url`
- `attribution`
- `fetched_at`
- `manual`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Likely related tables:

- future `company_event_origins` if event dates are discovered through feed items, notebook entries, or transcript segments

Rules:

- Events belong to exactly one company.
- `event_date` is required.
- `event_time` is optional because many sources publish only a date.
- Manual events must be distinguishable from sourced events.
- Sourced events must preserve source URL, attribution, fetched timestamp, and source event key when available.
- Sourced event identity uses `(source_adapter_id, source_event_key)` when both values are present.
- Sourced event refreshes update the existing source-keyed row when event date, title, status, source URL, attribution, or fetched timestamp changes.
- Manual events are for missing or user-known dates, not normal corrections to changed sourced events.

## Search Inputs

The first schema should leave room for search across:

- company ticker and display name
- feed item title and body text
- notebook title and Markdown body
- transcript segment text

SQLite FTS can be added after the base schema is stable.

## First Migration Scope

The first migration should create:

- companies
- company_aliases
- company_source_ids
- watchlists
- watchlist_companies
- source_adapters
- source_adapter_markets
- source_adapter_state
- feed_items
- feed_item_companies
- notebook_entries
- notebook_entry_tags
- notebook_entry_origins
- transcript_jobs
- transcript_segments
- ai_analysis_jobs
- ai_analysis_results
- ai_analysis_tags
- ai_analysis_source_references
- jobs
- settings

## Explicitly Deferred

Do not model these in v1:

- portfolio positions
- trades
- account balances
- billing records
- users or organizations
- cloud sync metadata
- team permissions
- cloud backup/sync metadata
